**Problem Statement**


Salary is hypothesized to depend on educational qualification and occupation. To understand the dependency, the salaries of 40 individuals [SalaryData.csv] are collected and each person’s educational qualification and occupation are noted. The dataset Education - Post 12th Standard.csv contains information on various colleges.

**Problem Statement**

The project involved drawing inferences from 2 case studies, namely - Bank Marketing & Insurance. The concepts of Clustering, CART, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network are used to draw inferences from these case studies. Various performance metrics have been used to validate the performance of predictions on Test & Train sets.

**Skills and Tools**

Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Linear discriminant Analysis

[Link to report](https://github.com/VKarelia/Projects_and_CaseStudies/blob/main/PGP_DSBA%20Great%20Lakes%20Institute%20of%20Management/Project%205%20-%20Predictive%20Modeling/Project%205%20-%20Business%20Report.pdf)

**Problem Statement**

**Gems & Holiday Package Prediction**

This project is based on 2 cases studies : Gems Price Prediction and Holiday Package prediction. In the first case study, concepts of linear regression are tested and it is expected from the learner to predict the price of gems based on multiple variables to help company maximize profits. In the second case, concepts of logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis are tested. One has to predict if the customer will purchase the holiday package to target the relevant customer base.

**[Tokyo 2021 Medals Prediction](https://github.com/VKarelia/Projects_and_CaseStudies/tree/main/PGP_DSBA%20Great%20Lakes%20Institute%20of%20Management/Tokyo%202020%20Medals%20Predictions)**

**Skills and Tools**

Web Scrapping, Linear Regression, Ridge and Lasso Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent 

[Link to report](https://medium.com/@kareliavaishnavi/tokyo-2021-olympics-medals-predictions-aceae04704f0)

**Problem Statement**

This case study is mainly focused on predicting the medals for Tokyo 2021 Olympics based on the factors affecting the country's performance in the Olympics. It can be argued that the country’s outcome in the Olympic games depends upon economic, demographic, and socio-economic factors such as GDP per capita, Population, Human Development Index(HDI), past performance of the country i.e. medals won in past Olympic games and whether the country hosting an Olympics event?

2. __IBM Data Science Professional Certificate__
            
### [Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto](https://github.com/VKarelia/Capstone-Projects/tree/main/IBM%20Data%20Science%20Professional%20Certificate/Segmenting%20and%20Clustering%20Neighborhoods%20in%20Toronto)
        
[Link to report](https://eu-gb.dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/analytics/notebooks/v2/109f3d8d-7c68-46e5-8c53-2b68cbd95929/view?access_token=a5c63daf1528f0e99538da0b07cc2a1fe143ad097181f4e8d39a873506b5b829)
        
In this assignment, I used the web-scraping technique to read the table of the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto based on the postalcode and borough information. 
Later I convert addresses into their equivalent latitude and longitude values based on Geospatial_Coordinates. Also, I used the Foursquare API to explore neighborhoods in Toronto City and 
used the explore function to get the most common venue categories in each neighborhood, and then use this feature to group the neighborhoods into clusters. I used the k-means clustering algorithm to complete this task. 
Finally, to visualize the neighborhoods in Toronto City and their emerging clusters I used the Folium library to map the city along with the clusters.
    
### [The Battle of Neighborhoods](https://github.com/VKarelia/Capstone-Projects/tree/main/IBM%20Data%20Science%20Professional%20Certificate/The%20Battle%20of%20Neighborhoods)

[Link to report](https://github.com/VKarelia/Projects_and_CaseStudies/blob/main/IBM%20Data%20Science%20Professional%20Certificate/The%20Battle%20of%20Neighborhoods/Battle%20of%20Neighborhoods%20-%20Report.pdf)

In this dataset I will explore two cities of India - Mumbai and Banglore. Suppose a person gets a job in Mumbai and/or in Banglore and they need to find a new place to live along with all the places to explore like trending resturants, food joints, parks, movie theater etc. Based on this assignment they can find a suitable place to live in the city with most favorable options. The datasets used for this case study is taken from Kaggle. Both the dataset includes neighbourhoods, type of properties, price of that properties, total area of the properties with their latitude and longitude. This will help us extract venues from the Foursquare api and divide them into different clusters. Here for the clusters, we will use K-means Clustering.
