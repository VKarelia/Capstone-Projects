# Projects and Case Studies

### This repository contains all the capstone projects and case studies performed in below listed courses:

1. __PGP in Data Science and Busniess Analytics - Great Lakes Institute of Management__

_Problem 1: Clustering_
A leading bank wants to develop a customer segmentation to give promotional offers to its customers.They collected a sample that summarizes the activities of users during the past few months. You aregiven the task to identify the segments based on credit card usage

_Problem 2: CART-RF-ANN_
An Insurance firm providing tour insurance is facing higher claim frequency. The management decidesto collect data from the past few years. You are assigned the task to make a model which predicts theclaim status and provide recommendations to management. Use CART, RF & ANN and compare themodels' performances in train and test sets.

[Tokyo 2020 Medals Prediction](https://github.com/VKarelia/Projects_and_CaseStudies/tree/main/PGP_DSBA%20Great%20Lakes%20Institute%20of%20Management/Tokyo%202020%20Medals%20Predictions)

This case study is mainly focused on predicting the medals for Tokyo 2021 Olympics based on the factors affecting the country's performance in the Olympics. It can be argued that the countryâ€™s outcome in the Olympic games depends upon economic, demographic, and socio-economic factors such as GDP per capita, Population, Human Development Index(HDI), past performance of the country i.e. medals won in past Olympic games and whether the country hosting an Olympics event?

[Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto](https://github.com/VKarelia/Capstone-Projects/tree/main/IBM%20Data%20Science%20Professional%20Certificate/Segmenting%20and%20Clustering%20Neighborhoods%20in%20Toronto)

In this assignment, I used the web-scraping technique to read the table of the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto based on the postalcode and borough information. 
Later I convert addresses into their equivalent latitude and longitude values based on Geospatial_Coordinates. Also, I used the Foursquare API to explore neighborhoods in Toronto City and 
used the explore function to get the most common venue categories in each neighborhood, and then use this feature to group the neighborhoods into clusters. I used the k-means clustering algorithm to complete this task. 
Finally, to visualize the neighborhoods in Toronto City and their emerging clusters I used the Folium library to map the city along with the clusters.
    
[The Battle of Neighborhoods](https://github.com/VKarelia/Capstone-Projects/tree/main/IBM%20Data%20Science%20Professional%20Certificate/The%20Battle%20of%20Neighborhoods)

In this dataset I will explore two cities of India - Mumbai and Banglore. Suppose a person gets a job in Mumbai and/or in Banglore and they need to find a new place to live along with all the places to explore like trending resturants, food joints, parks, movie theater etc. Based on this assignment they can find a suitable place to live in the city with most favorable options. The datasets used for this case study is taken from Kaggle. Both the dataset includes neighbourhoods, type of properties, price of that properties, total area of the properties with their latitude and longitude. This will help us extract venues from the Foursquare api and divide them into different clusters. Here for the clusters, we will use K-means Clustering.
