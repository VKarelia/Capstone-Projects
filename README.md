        Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto
        
    In this assignment, I used the web-scraping technique to read the table of the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto based on the postalcode and borough information. 
    Later I convert addresses into their equivalent latitude and longitude values based on Geospatial_Coordinates. Also, I used the Foursquare API to explore neighborhoods in Toronto City and 
    used the explore function to get the most common venue categories in each neighborhood, and then use this feature to group the neighborhoods into clusters. I used the k-means clustering algorithm to complete this task. 
    Finally, to visualize the neighborhoods in Toronto City and their emerging clusters I used the Folium library to map the city along with the clusters.
