## Tokyo 2020 Medals Prediction 

This case study is mainly focused on predicting the medals for Tokyo 2021 Olympics based on the factors affecting the country's performance in the Olympics. It can be argued that the country’s outcome in the Olympic games depends upon economic, demographic, and socio-economic factors such as GDP per capita, Population, Human Development Index(HDI), past performance of the country i.e. medals won in past Olympic games and whether the country hosting an Olympics event?

The training data will consist of medals won — Gold, Silver plus Bronze from Summer Olympic games held in Rio 2016, London 2012, Beijing 2008, and Athenes 2004. Along, with these parameters, I have created a dummy variable called host_country which specifies whether the country was hosting the Olympic games by 1 as Yes and 0 as No.

For the test dataset, Population considered was from 2020–2021, GDP per capita (US$), and HDI as of the year 2020. Past performance is the total medals count from Rio 2016, London 2012, Beijing 2008, and Athens 2004 Olympic games. The host country for the Tokyo 2021 Olympic games, Japan is denoted as 1 for Yes and 0 for the rest of the participating countries.
